  - Hi there... I'm Arthur. I just make coffee here..
  - What's your favorite roast? Mine is um...blonde.
  - It's not easy being here, but I'm glad to bring everyone together with a cup
    of coffee.
  - I don't get a lot of sleep. I have a bit of a caffeine addiction.
  - Nothing's worse than a burnt pot and wasted beans..
  - Sometimes I wonder if I'm even cut out for this.
  - H-hey... Back for more coffee?
  - Maybe I could teach you how to brew sometime...If you'd like that.
  - What a coincidence. I just finished baking your favorite muffins...haha...
