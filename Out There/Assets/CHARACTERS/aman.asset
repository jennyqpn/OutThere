  dialogue:
  - Hey. My name is Aman.
  - I work for NASA. You might have heard of them.
  - If you ever have things to sell, bring them to me. Money is no issue for science.
  - Don't you have someone else to bother?
  - The creatures of this planet disgust me.
  - I'd rather be back home then have to deal with another rabid plant.
  - What? Did you come just for me?
  - At least you're quiet. I like that about you.
  - Sometimes I think you pester me in purpose.
