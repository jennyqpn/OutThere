  - Hey! I'm so glad your here! Your good ol' pal Marina missed you.
  - As you know I'm a botanist, so I'm glad you could help take on this project.
  - The wildlands have amazing plant life. I need to do some research.
  - Someone stepped on my samples earlier.
  - NASA thinks they can just come here and take over my research. I won't let them.
  - I'm only so angry because I'm passionate.
  - Thanks for coming to see me, I missed ya.
  - You're as sweet as honeysuckle you know.
  - Aw shucks, every time I see you I know it's going to be just fine.
