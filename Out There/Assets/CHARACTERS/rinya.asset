  dialogue:
  - Hey! you must be the new human. I'm Rinya.
  - My name in our language means "vast." What does yours mean?
  - I wonder what Earth is like compared to here.
  - I saw a flower yesterday but now it's gone. Oh well.
  - Sometimes I hear the human man over there scoff when I walk by.
  - Do you think you'll go back home eventually?
  - Oh you're so sweet to talk to me so often.
  - Maybe you could let me visit your farm sometime.
  - Humans are so adorable. Well, mostly you.
