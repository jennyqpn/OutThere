  dialogue:
  - Hey! Marina told me all about you. I'm Ashley!
  - I'm an engineer, but I also like to sing. It's a hobby of mine.
  - If you ever need a house upgrade, let me know!
  - I'm not really feeling well right now. Terrible migraine.
  - I thought I had this figured out. Turns out I'm right back where I started.
  - Maybe we're all just cogs in the machine.
  - I'm so glad you stopped by, I could use the company.
  - I'd like to write a song about you someday.
  - Maybe when you're not busy, we can take a walk out into the wildlands together.
