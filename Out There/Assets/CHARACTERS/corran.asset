  dialogue:
  - Name's Corran. What about you?
  - You might have seen my sister around here. Tall, blue skin. Can't miss her.
  - I'm a warrior from our tribe. I noticed you looking at the scar.
  - That guy, Aman. There's something I don't like about him.
  - We're peaceful until threatened.
  - Sorry, I'm a little busy right now.
  - Well, I suppose you're easy enough on the eyes.
  - I'd like to take you on a little adventure sometime soon. Let's get out of this
    town.
  - What do you humans call it again? A crush?
